ToDo:

Limitations:

* Microsoft Graph module is unable to list members private SharePoints, so AzureAD module persists, could be moved to SharePoint Online (SPO) module.
* Microsoft Graph module is unable to list members of private Teams, so Module Teams module persists.
* Microsoft Graph module is unable to properly list Shared Mailboxes, so ExchangeOnline module persists.
* DLMemberships TAB do not list Owners, need to improve script
* ADMIN-install-modules.ps1 can warn `'PackageManagement' is currently in use`, it's safe to ignore this warning.
* Find a way to list last user login and activity, last signin call using Microsoft Graph requires AD Premium license.
* AzureAD module is being deprecated but used for several calls, need to look for alternatives.
* Microsoft Graph API workaround Microsoft Graph module limitations but requires app registration.
* Pending to validate Shared channels on Teams if they will add note related to unable to catch users
