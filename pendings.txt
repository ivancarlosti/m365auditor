ToDo:

* ADMIN-install-modules.ps1 can warn `'PackageManagement' is currently in use`, it's safe to ignore this warning.
* Find a way to list last user login and activity, last signin call using Microsoft Graph requires AD Premium license.
* Microsoft Graph API workaround Microsoft Graph module limitations but requires app registration.
* Pending to validate Shared channels on Teams if they will add note related to unable to catch users
* Improve Shared Mailbox with members
* Create delegated mailbox TAB
* Improve DLs merging members and owners using ExchangeOnline module, owners list have issue reporting System.Object[]
* List aliases of all mail accounts (users, dls, sharepoint)
* List 2FA settings of Microsoft 365 (portal admins + enforced rule + AzureAD)
